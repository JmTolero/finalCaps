# Railway Deployment Guide - Step by Step

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account with your code pushed
- Railway account (sign up at https://railway.app)
- Database ready (MySQL on Railway or external)

## Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway

### 1.1. Create New Project
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Railway will detect Node.js automatically

### 1.2. Configure Build Settings
1. Go to project Settings
2. Under "Root Directory", enter: `backend`
3. Under "Build Command", it should auto-detect: `npm install`
4. Under "Start Command", it should be: `node src/server.js`

### 1.3. Add Environment Variables

Go to your project â†’ Variables tab and add:

```
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production

# Database (if using Railway MySQL)
# Railway will provide these automatically if you add MySQL plugin
DB_HOST=${MYSQLHOST}
DB_USER=${MYSQLUSER}
DB_PASSWORD=${MYSQLPASSWORD}
DB_NAME=${MYSQLDATABASE}
DB_PORT=${MYSQLPORT}

# Or if using external database, add your own values:
# DB_HOST=your-db-host.com
# DB_USER=your-db-user
# DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
# DB_NAME=chillnet_db
# DB_PORT=3306

# Admin Credentials (CHANGE THESE!)
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here

# Frontend URL (Your Vercel URL - add this after deploying frontend)
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app

# Upload directory for Railway
UPLOAD_DIR=/app/uploads/vendor-documents/
```

### 1.4. Add MySQL Database (if needed)

1. In your Railway project, click "New" â†’ "Database" â†’ "Add MySQL"
2. Railway will automatically create and link the database
3. The database environment variables will be available as `MYSQLHOST`, `MYSQLUSER`, etc.
4. Reference them in your variables as shown above

### 1.5. Add Storage Volume for File Uploads

**Important:** Railway's filesystem is ephemeral. Files are deleted on redeployment.

To persist uploaded files:
1. Go to your service â†’ Settings â†’ Volumes
2. Click "Add Volume"
3. Mount Path: `/app/uploads`
4. Size: Start with 1GB (adjust as needed)
5. Click "Add Volume"

### 1.6. Deploy

1. Railway should auto-deploy after pushing to GitHub
2. Or click "Deploy" button manually
3. Wait for deployment to complete (watch the logs)

### 1.7. Get Your Railway URL

1. Go to Settings â†’ Domains
2. Click "Generate Domain"
3. You'll get a URL like: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`
4. **Copy this URL** - you'll need it for Vercel!

### 1.8. Test Backend

Visit in browser:
```
https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/db/health
```

Should return: `{"ok": true}`

## Step 2: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

### 2.1. Prepare Frontend

Make sure your frontend code is pushed to GitHub.

### 2.2. Import to Vercel

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click "Add New..." â†’ "Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Configure:
   - **Root Directory:** `frontend`
   - **Framework Preset:** Create React App (auto-detected)
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build` (auto-detected)
   - **Output Directory:** `build` (auto-detected)

### 2.3. Add Environment Variable

**Before deploying**, add environment variable:

1. Expand "Environment Variables" section
2. Add:
   - **Name:** `REACT_APP_API_URL`
   - **Value:** `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app` (your Railway URL)
   - **Environments:** Select all (Production, Preview, Development)
3. Click "Add"

### 2.4. Deploy

1. Click "Deploy"
2. Wait for deployment (2-3 minutes)
3. Vercel will give you a URL like: `https://your-app.vercel.app`

### 2.5. Update Railway FRONTEND_URL

**Important:** Go back to Railway and update the `FRONTEND_URL` variable with your Vercel URL:

1. Railway Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Variables
2. Edit `FRONTEND_URL` to: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
3. Railway will automatically redeploy

## Step 3: Test Everything

### 3.1. Test Frontend
1. Visit your Vercel URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
2. Should load without errors
3. Open browser console (F12) - check for errors

### 3.2. Test Registration
1. Register a new user
2. If successful, backend connection works! âœ…

### 3.3. Test Vendor Registration with Images
1. Go to "Become a Vendor"
2. Upload Valid ID, Business Permit, Proof Image
3. Submit application
4. Check browser Network tab - uploads should go to Railway URL

### 3.4. Test Admin Panel
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Vendor Approval
3. Click on pending vendor
4. Images should display correctly âœ…

### 3.5. Test from Mobile
1. Open Vercel URL on phone
2. Register as vendor with images
3. Check if images appear on admin panel
4. If yes, CORS is working correctly! âœ…

## Step 4: Monitor and Maintain

### Railway Monitoring
- **Logs:** Railway Dashboard â†’ Your Service â†’ Logs
- **Metrics:** Check CPU, Memory, Network usage
- **Deployments:** View deployment history and status

### Vercel Monitoring
- **Deployments:** Vercel Dashboard â†’ Deployments
- **Analytics:** Check page views and performance
- **Functions:** Monitor serverless function execution

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Loading

**1. Check Network Tab (F12)**
- Look at failed requests
- Check if image URLs are correct
- Should be: `https://your-backend.railway.app/uploads/...`

**2. Check Railway Logs**
```
Railway Dashboard â†’ Your Service â†’ View Logs
```
Look for:
- File upload errors
- Permission errors
- CORS errors

**3. Check CORS**
- Verify `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway matches your Vercel URL exactly
- Include protocol: `https://your-app.vercel.app` (not `your-app.vercel.app`)

**4. Check Volume Mount**
- Ensure volume is mounted at `/app/uploads`
- Verify `UPLOAD_DIR` environment variable is set

### Database Connection Issues

**Check Railway Variables:**
```bash
# In Railway logs, you should see connection attempt
# If it fails, verify these are set correctly:
DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME, DB_PORT
```

**Test Database Connection:**
Add this to your backend temporarily:
```javascript
pool.query('SELECT 1 AS test', (err, results) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Database connection failed:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('Database connected successfully:', results);
  }
});
```

### CORS Errors

**Symptoms:**
- "Access to fetch blocked by CORS policy"
- "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header"

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway is correct
2. Check backend CORS configuration in `app.js`
3. Ensure you redeployed backend after adding `FRONTEND_URL`
4. Check Railway logs for CORS warning messages

### Environment Variables Not Working

**In Vercel:**
- Variables must start with `REACT_APP_`
- Must redeploy after adding/changing variables
- Check: Settings â†’ Environment Variables

**In Railway:**
- Changes trigger automatic redeploy
- Check: Variables tab
- View logs to confirm variables are loaded

2. **Use strong passwords** for admin and database
3. **Keep dependencies updated:** `npm audit fix`
4. **Monitor logs** for suspicious activity
5. **Set up database backups** (Railway provides automatic backups)
6. **Use environment variables** for all secrets âœ…
7. **Configure CORS properly** âœ… (done)

## Quick Reference

**Railway Backend URL:** `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`
**Vercel Frontend URL:** `https://your-app.vercel.app`

**Environment Variables:**
- Railway: `FRONTEND_URL` = Vercel URL
- Vercel: `REACT_APP_API_URL` = Railway URL

**Important:** Both must reference each other for CORS to work!

Your app is now deployed and ready to use! ðŸš€

All the fixes we made ensure images work perfectly in production. The environment variable approach means your app works seamlessly in any environment.
