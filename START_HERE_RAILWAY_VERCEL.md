## 🎯 Deploy in 3 Steps

### Step 1️⃣: Deploy Backend to Railway (5 minutes)

1. Go to **https://railway.app**
2. New Project → Deploy from GitHub
3. Select your repo → Choose `backend` folder
4. Add these environment variables:
   ```
   PORT=3001
   NODE_ENV=production
   ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_password
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
   UPLOAD_DIR=/app/uploads/vendor-documents/
   ```
   (Plus your database credentials)

5. Add Volume: Settings → Volumes → `/app/uploads`
6. Generate Domain → **Copy the URL** (like `https://xyz.railway.app`)

### Step 2️⃣: Deploy Frontend to Vercel (3 minutes)

1. Go to **https://vercel.com**
2. New Project → Import from GitHub
3. Select your repo → Choose `frontend` folder
4. Add environment variable:
   - **Name:** `REACT_APP_API_URL`
   - **Value:** Your Railway URL (from Step 1)
5. Deploy → **Copy the Vercel URL**

### Step 3️⃣: Connect Them (1 minute)

1. Go back to Railway
2. Update environment variable:
   - **FRONTEND_URL** = Your Vercel URL (from Step 2)
3. Railway auto-redeploys
4. **Done!** 🎉

## 🆘 Common Issues

### Images Not Loading?
- ✅ Check `REACT_APP_API_URL` in Vercel
- ✅ Check `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway
- ✅ Both must use `https://`
- ✅ Redeploy after changing variables

### CORS Error?
- ✅ Verify `FRONTEND_URL` matches your Vercel URL exactly
- ✅ Include the full URL with `https://`

---

## ✨ What Was Fixed

**Before:** Admin pages used hardcoded `localhost:3001` → Only worked on your computer

**After:** Uses `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL` → Works everywhere (local, network, production)

**Files updated:**
- ✅ `frontend/src/pages/admin/vendorApproval.jsx`
- ✅ `frontend/src/pages/admin/usermanagement.jsx`
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/admin/VendorDetailView.jsx`
- ✅ `backend/src/app.js` (CORS for production)
- ✅ `backend/src/server.js` (network access)

## 🎯 Your URLs After Deployment

**Backend (Railway):** `https://_______________.up.railway.app`

**Frontend (Vercel):** `https://_______________.vercel.app`

*Save these for reference!*

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Railway MySQL** - Easiest database setup
2. **Enable Auto-Deploy** - Push to GitHub = auto-deploy
3. **Monitor Logs** - Check for errors after deployment
4. **Test on Mobile** - Verify images load on phone
5. **Set Strong Password** - Change default admin password
