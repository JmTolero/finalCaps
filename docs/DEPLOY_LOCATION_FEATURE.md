### **Option 1: Full Deployment (Recommended)**

```bash
# 1. Go to project root
cd C:\Users\jethe\OneDrive\Documents\Joe\CapsProject

# 2. Add all changes to git
git add .

# 3. Commit with message
git commit -m "Add exact vendor GPS location feature"

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# 5. Wait for Vercel to auto-deploy (2-3 minutes)
```

Then check your deployed site!

---

### **Option 2: Test Locally First**

```bash
# 1. Go to frontend directory
cd C:\Users\jethe\OneDrive\Documents\Joe\CapsProject\frontend

# 2. Start development server
npm start
